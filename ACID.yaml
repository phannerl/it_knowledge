ACID        - Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.
Transaction - Collection of queries 
            - An unit of work
Atomicity   - Entity transaction must finish / Rollback all queries if a query fails.
Consistency - Consistency in Data ->  Defined by the user in table schema
                                  ->  Referential intergrity(FK)
                                  ->  Atomicity
                                  ->  Isolation
            - Consistency in Reads
Isolation   - Read phenomena  ->  Dirty Reads
                            ->  Non-repeatable reads
                            ->  Phantom Reads
            - Isolation Levels  ->  Read uncommited
                              ->  Read commited
                              ->  Repeatable Read
                              ->  Serializable 
            -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)
Durability  -> Commited transaction must be persisted in a durable non-volatile storage.
