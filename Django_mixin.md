**Mixins**: 
  - Essentially reusable pieces of code that can be added to a class to give it additional functionality
  - In Django, mixins are used to add functionality to views, forms, and models
  =>  To reuse code and improve the efficiency of their applications
  - Mixins are typically defined as classes, and can be added to other classes by using inheritance.

Some of the most commonly used mixins include:
  - LoginRequiredMixin: A view mixin that requires the user to be logged in before accessing the view.
  - FormMixin: A view mixin that provides functionality for handling forms.
  - ModelFormMixin: A view mixin that provides functionality for handling model forms.
  - PermissionRequiredMixin: A view mixin that requires the user to have a specific permission before accessing the view.
  - CreateView: A view mixin that provides functionality for creating objects.
  - UpdateView: A view mixin that provides functionality for updating objects.
  - DeleteView: A view mixin that provides functionality for deleting objects.

FormMixin: The FormMixin is a view mixin that provides functionality for handling forms. It includes methods for rendering a form, validating form data, and handling form submission. Here's an example of how to use the FormMixin in a view:
  ```python
    from django.views.generic.edit import FormMixin
    from django.views.generic import ListView

    class MyView(FormMixin, ListView):
        form_class = MyForm
        template_name = 'my_template.html'

        def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
            self.object_list = self.get_queryset()
            form = self.get_form()
            return self.render_to_response(self.get_context_data(form=form))
        
        def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
            self.object_list = self.get_queryset()
            form = self.get_form()
            if form.is_valid():
                return self.form_valid(form)
            else:
                return self.form_invalid(form)
        
        def form_valid(self, form):
            # do something with the form data
            return super().form_valid(form)
  ```
