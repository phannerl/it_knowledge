A request works in a network: 
1. Initiation: The process begins when a client device, such as a computer or smartphone, initiates a request. 
  - This could be triggered by a user action (like clicking a link in a web browser) or by an application running on the device (like an email client fetching new messages).

2. Formulation: The client formulates a request message, which typically includes details about what the client is asking for and any additional information needed for the server to fulfill the request. 
  - For example: In a web request, this might include the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the desired web page, any parameters for the request, and information about the client itself (such as its IP address or browser type).

3. Transmission: Once the request message is formulated, it is transmitted over the network to the server. This transmission usually occurs using one of several network protocols, such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for web requests, SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for email requests, or FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for file transfer requests.

4. Routing: Within the network, routers and other networking devices help route the request message from the client to the appropriate server. This often involves multiple hops through various network devices before reaching its destination.

5. Processing: Upon receiving the request, the server processes it to determine how to respond. This might involve accessing databases, running applications, or performing other tasks necessary to fulfill the request.

6. Response: After processing the request, the server generates a response message containing the requested information or indicating the outcome of the request (such as success or failure). 
  - This response is then sent back to the client over the network.

7. Reception: Finally, the client receives the response message and processes it accordingly. 
  - For example, in the case of a web request, the client's web browser would render the received HTML content and display it to the user.

The basic steps involved in a typical request-response cycle:

1. Client Initiates Request:
  - A request starts with the client, which could be a web browser, a mobile app, or any device capable of making network requests.
  - The client initiates a request when a user interacts with a web page, clicks a link, submits a form, or triggers any action that requires data from a server.

2. DNS Resolution:
  - If the request involves a domain name (e.g., www.example.com), the client needs to resolve the domain name to an IP address. This is done through the Domain Name System (DNS).

3. TCP/IP Connection:
  - Once the IP address is obtained, the client establishes a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection with the server. TCP ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data between the client and server.
4. HTTP Request:
  - The client sends an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request to the server. The request includes information such as the method (GET, POST, etc.), the requested resource (URL), headers (metadata about the request), and, in the case of a POST request, the data being sent.

5. Server Processes Request:
  - The server receives the HTTP request and processes it. The server may perform various tasks depending on the nature of the request, such as fetching data from a database, executing server-side code, or handling file uploads.

6. Server Sends Response:
  - After processing the request, the server generates an HTTP response. The response includes a status code indicating the outcome of the request (e.g., 200 OK for success, 404 Not Found for a missing resource) and the actual data, typically in the form of HTML, JSON, or another format depending on the request.

7. TCP/IP Connection Closure:
  - The server sends the HTTP response back to the client through the established TCP connection.

8. Client Processes Response:
  - The client receives the response, and if it's a web browser, it renders the content received from the server.

9. Client-Side Processing:
  - The client may perform additional processing, such as executing JavaScript code, rendering images, or updating the user interface based on the received data.

10. Connection Closure:
  - Once the data is transferred and processed, the TCP connection is closed. This marks the completion of the request-response cycle.
